# Things to do:

## JS-Tools:

### Matrix:

-Seems like the rotation 3D is useless.
-Seems like the rotation Origin = rotation normal.

· IDEA: TRY TO DO REFLEXIONS IN ORDER TO ROTATE FROM ORIGIN

· IDEA: WHAT IF I MAKE A FUNCTION TO MAKE A ROTATION MATRIX THAT HAS THE OLD ROTATION MATRIX. CHECKS A VECTOR (0,0,1) WITH THE OLD ROTATION AND DETECTS THE NEW AXIS REQUIRED??
